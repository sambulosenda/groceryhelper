Grocery Helper 
Program licensed under the Apache License. See LICENSE for more details.

This application is designed to help you with your grocery shopping. It can keep track of your current shopping bill and you can create a grocery list. 

I do have a todo list of features that would greatly enhance the functionality.

TODO: create multiple lists for potential shopping at different stores on the same trip. 
TODO: keep track of totals of previous trips. 
TODO: save prices of particular items so that when you cross something off a list, it can be added to the current bill automatically. 


The application shows knowledge of the following aspects of android development:
activity switching and state saving.
passing bundles.
sending and receiving broadcasts using intents.
persistent data storage.
creating custom parcelable classes.
